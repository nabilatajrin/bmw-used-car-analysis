## Objective
This project visualizes the data and analyzes the relationship between variables of used Ford cars.

## Variables
Model, year, price, transmission, mileage, fuelType, mpg, and engineSize.

## The data has been visualized using:
Barplot, histogram, ECDF etc.

## Tasks:
Create a figure of barplot that will contain multiple subplots. Each subplot will represent a column.
Make sure you have a proper title, xlabel, ylabel, xticks, yticks, and figure size which will represent an example of good data visualization.
Use the Markdown cell for proper commenting and make sure the code easily understandable. Use the .head() or .tail() method when necessary rather than displaying all the rows in the dataframe.
Make sure your code is reusable and reproducible.
